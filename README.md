# WordPress Starter Plugin

This repo is the starter plugin based off the starter plugin from [KnowTheCode.io](https://knowthecode.io). Check out the [Letâ€™s Build a WordPress Starter Plugin](https://knowthecode.io/labs/lets-build-wordpress-starter-plugin) lab, where you will build this custom plugin with [Tonya](https://knowthecode.io/about) as she explains each step.

## Features

This plugin includes the following features:

1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - Dependency Manager for PHP
2. [Kint](http://raveren.github.io/kint/) - Awesome package that helps you to debug - forget `var_dump` and `print_r`. You are going to love Kint.
3. [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops) - Oh man, you will wonder why this isn't built into PHP. When an error occurs, this displayer replaces out the PHP orange table and gives you information you can actually use.
4. Koop Debug, to output objects in an orderly fashion.
